Student Information System

This project is an early stage student information system that a school or university would use to keep track of students, payments, courses taken, etc. The purpose of this project was to begin the process of redesigning an older application to replace legacy frameworks and allowing for quicker development of new features with latest technology. The technology used so far in this application is React and Firebase.
